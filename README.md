# ðŸŽ° Project: Slot Machine

### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

This project is a slot machine with 3 reels & 5 rolls


### How it's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

I took inspiration from the a japanese style casino & made it food themed.

### Optimizations


### Lessons Learned
I learned alot about formula's for creating a random chance to win & lose.
The slot machine also taught me alot to breakthings down step by step even breaking a single step into multiple steps.
